        <h1 class="text-center";><strong>Who am I?</strong></h1>
        <p class = "text-center"> My name is Matthew Stewart, and I am a leader and software developer from Powhatan, Virginia. I attend a newly opened Richmond based regional highschool that specializes in computer science, its unique workplace enviroment, and cultural diversity that matches that of Richmond.</p>
        <p class = "text-center"> Right now, my focus is on my academics and lending a hand in any extracurriculars that I can take part in. With the help of J Sargent Reynolds, I will graduate in 2020 with an Associate's Degree in Computer Science, along with an Advanced Diploma.</p>
        <p class = "text-center"> Inside of school I partake in activities that can vary from founding and participating in clubs, to serving in student council as Vice President and Student School Board Representative, and leading tours around the school when officials from my county decide to visit our school.</p>
        <p class = "text-center"> Outside of school I am normally playing some kind of a videogame with friends, or doing work related to academics at school.  </p>
        <h2 class="text-center">Computer Science Experience</h2>
        <p class = "text-center">My journey with computer science has been a long one, I have been interested in computers and their limitations since I was old enough to start learning how one worked. From there, my curiosity carried me to a game design class at Powhatan High School.</p>
        <p class = "text-center"> This elective class would be what took me from learning how to code a sloppy GameMaker Studio game, and would point me in the direction of my current school, where I would learn much of Python and Java in just over 18 months. </p>
        <P class = "text-center"> Directly after completing the Dual Enrollment course that taught me the basics of Java, I started to learn HTML and CSS in order to create the website you are currently on. I taught myself to work with Bootstrap before diving fully into CSS, due to hearing about it when researching.</p>
        <p class = "text-center"> I am enjoying my exploration into the world of computer science, and I have no intention to stop learning, or to ever stop working towards whatever goals I may set. I strive to refine myself further in everything I do. </p>
        <p class = "text-center"> Below you will find a table showing what languages I have learned and how long I have spent with each mentioned language.</p>

        <table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Language</th>
      <th scope="col">Time Spent</th>
      <th scope="col">Notes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Python</th>
      <td>9 months</td>
      <td>I learned Python through an online service named Edgenuity, along with a teacher.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Java</th>
      <td>2 months</td>
      <td>Six week Dual Enrollment class introduced me to Java, ask to see my final project.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">HTML & CSS</th>
      <td>2 months</td>
      <td>Putting these two together because of the fact that I started to learn both at the same time. I am stronger in HTML then I am in CSS, due to focusing on bootstrap interactions before working on my own custom CSS.</td>
    </tr>
